Hey there,

We hope you¡¯re enjoying your time with us so far! Here at Code School, we truly believe that learning by doing is the best way to master a skill, and we offer a few different ways to do that based on your goals.

 Paths
Paths group courses by topic and offer a roadmap to learn that gradually gets more difficult with each step.

 Courses
Watch a lesson and then apply what you just learned with coding challenges. Great for picking up new skills or practicing those you already have.

 Screencasts
We have three different types of screencasts that are each crafted for a unique learning goal.

Watch Us Build - Watch as instructors build apps from scratch or download the source code from GitHub and build alongside them.
Feature Focus - Practical feature builds and development problem solving for well-known sites like Basecamp.
Code TV - Quick learning snippets for specific technologies and tools.
Happy learning, 
Hal at Code School
